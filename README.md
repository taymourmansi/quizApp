#The Quiz App

The purpose of this application is to create general knowledge quiz to test your knowledge!

##How It Works

The application is using TKinter and python to create the Graphical User Interface(GUI) and the general brain behind the quiz, as well as the Open Trivia Database API. We create the GUI using TKinter to be as user friendly as possible,a simple green check mark and a red x for true and false,respectively, are used to choose your answer, and once completed the quiz stops and gives you your score. The questions for the quiz are pulled from the Open Trivia Database API and are pulled every time the application runs,so the questions are always up to date.
